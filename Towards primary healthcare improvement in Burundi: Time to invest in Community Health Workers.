## Towards primary healthcare improvement in Burundi: Time to invest in Community Health  Workers.  

### Introduction 
Primary healthcare (PHC) is widely recognized as a fundamental element of successful  healthcare systems and serves as the cornerstone of Universal Health Coverage1. Community  health is an integral part of primary health care and community health workers (CHWs) play a  vital role in providing curative and preventive healthcare services in the community2. CHWs  are therefore essential to ensuring global health security and play a crucial role in health  equity. In Burundi, CHWs work voluntarily and there is no formalized employment model for  them. They don't have monthly salaries like other healthcare professionals. CHW programs continue to face challenges in terms of adequate support; including financial ones. And, these  factors serve to demotivate CHWs and affect therefore retention and the sustainability of  community-based health programmes3. This commentary aims to inform policy intervention  on the importance of investing in CHWs and highlights an innovative approach to investment  in CHWs.  
Opportunities and challenges to investing in community health workers 
In March 2023, the 3rd International Community Health Workers Symposium held in  Monrovia aimed to advance CHW Programs as essential to building resilient and equitable  health systems to improve PHC 4. The symposium recognized that to be fully effective, CHWs  need to be trained, supervised and paid a decent wage and thus call countries to invest in  country-led community health strategies, make professional CHWs the norm, integrate CHWs  into human resource and health sector plans, galvanize political support and track progress of  CHW programs5.  
Studies have shown that investing in professional CHWs can produce a 10 to 1 return on every  dollar invested as a result of healthier populations and additional societal benefits including  the empowerment of women and household income for paid CHWs6. In Indonesia, a study  showed the cost-effectiveness of CHWs in stunting eradication. CHWs who are receiving  monetary incentives are twice as likely to initiate home-based stunting education within their  communities compared to CHWs who don’t receive monetary incentives7. Billard et al8,  recognized that investing in CHWs through equipment, training, and remuneration can help  prevent epidemics from turning into pandemics, and maintain the provision of healthcare in  the event of major disruption. 
Burundian CHWs get incentives through the performance-based financing approach (PBF)9.  However, some reports argue that reliance on performance-based incentives alone does not  provide CHWs with financial security and may ultimately hinder CHW rights10. Furthermore,  to optimize the CHWs program, the 2018 WHO guideline suggests that CHWs should not be  exclusively or primarily remunerated on the basis of performance-based incentives11. The Burundian government should consider financial rewards for CHWs as an integral part of  overall health system planning. However, in its community health strategy, the Burundi  government doesn’t have a plan to pay CHWs12. Adding to the fact that some intermediate  objectives to achieve Universal Health Coverage are not yet achieved, the question is whether 
the country is ready to invest enough in primary healthcare through CHWs. For example, the  government has not met the agreed target of allocating at least 15% of its annual budget to  improve the health sector set in the 2001 Abuja declaration13,14. One of the reasons for the  concern is the political leadership which prioritises other sectors than the heath sector in  terms of budget allocation15. 

### An entrepreneurial model to empower economically CHWs 
Authors recognize the challenge for many countries to secure sustainable funding for  community health programs, including remuneration for community health workers16. But  considering the important role of CHWs in hard-to-reach areas where resources are limited  and the worries of the shortage of human resources for the health sector which is projected  to be 43 million health workers by 2030 including CHWs, countries such as Burundi should  find other monetary motivations to complete the PBF incentives. 11,17 One of the solutions we  propose in this commentary is the Community Health Entrepreneurship approach.  
The community health entrepreneurship approach has been implemented by Healthy  Entrepreneurs (HE), a Dutch social enterprise with a vision of basic healthcare for all, working  with community health workers from rural zones through a social business model that  transforms them into community Health Entrepreneurs (CHEs). HE involves rural CHWs in a  social business model that allows them to improve access to health information, services, and  products in their communities while generating income. They are trained in health promotion  and entrepreneurship to provide health education and give access to affordable health  products such as personal hygiene products, water filters, nutrition-fortified products,  vitamins, and essential medicines (like paracetamol, worm medicines, and antimalaria pills).  In addition, CHEs digitally manage their activities (health promotion and entrepreneurship) through solar-powered smartphones. Generated incomes served as a new financial  motivation for those volunteer health workers. The model is currently active in 3 low- and  middle-income countries (Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania) and is being tested in Burundi,  Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Nigeria. 
Some authors have argued that social entrepreneurship can be most effective in reaching  most at-risk individuals or communities that would be impossible to reach using social  entrepreneurial tools, such as social marketing, conditional cash transfers, and  microenterprise18. Earlier results of the HE model have been observed in Uganda. Robert A J et al19 showed that CHEs positively affect the sexual and reproductive health status of  communities in terms of knowledge of sexually transmitted infections and the use of modern  contraceptive methods such as pills, implants, and injections. Indeed, his study showed that  the use of modern contraceptive methods was higher among rural communities exposed to  CHEs compared with communities covered by regular CHWs.  
Burundi has a predominantly rural population (80%), with a geographical relief that makes  hard access to healthcare, particularly for maternal and child health20. CHWs are therefore  essential to overcome the inequality in healthcare provision due to geographical disparities.  The profile of these CHWs is predominantly female, and studies have confirmed that female  CHWs perform much better than male CHWs12. Nevertheless, considering the responsibilities
assigned to women in Burundian culture, they represent pillars indispensable to the economic  development of their families and the country as a whole. Unable to pay them, the Burundi  government can see such a model as an opportunity to make these women volunteers  financially independent. This would also keep them motivated and make the community  health worker system more sustainable and resilient. 
Moreover, for a country where over 50% of children under age five suffer from chronic  malnutrition, the model, via its community-based distribution network, offers an opportunity  to provide health services and products to alleviate these concerns, while promoting the  national economy19,21,22. This is also valid for other health problems facing the country such  as population growth or the demographic transition with the growth of non-communicable  diseases in rural areas. 
In addition, In low-resource settings, studies have confirmed the improvement of primary  healthcare, particularly in maternal and child health, HIV, tuberculosis and sexual and  reproductive health when CHWs are equipped with mobile technology23. In north-western  Burundi where antenatal care attendance is significantly low compared to the countrywide  levels, Misago et al24 tested a digital smartphone-based intervention enabling antenatal  consultation reminders and follow-up via CHWs, nurses and midwives. Results showed that  after two months, the approach allowed 80% of mothers to constantly attend antenatal care appointments with an increase of 200% from the baseline. Thus, for a country which is  gradually committing to digitalize healthcare at the community level, particularly maternal  and child health, the Healthy Entrepreneurs approach where CHWs are equipped with  smartphones, could be a great opportunity to vulgarize Misago's intervention. 
Although the model presents opportunities, it is more than essential to maintain a certain  ethic to avoid any form of deviance. Indeed, any entrepreneurial model, whether social or  capitalist, generates profit, whatever it may be. It is therefore mandatory to monitor the  program to avoid turning community health workers into speculative traders. 

### Conclusion 
Remuneration of CHWs is actually a point of debate in the literature. There is a growing  consensus that community health workers should be paid. And, studies have confirmed the  cost-effectiveness in preventing diseases when further investments are initiated in the CHWs  system. The 2018 WHO Guideline strongly recommends remunerating CHWs for their work  with a financial package regarding the job demands and complexity, number of hours, training,  and roles that they undertake, and not paying community health workers exclusively or  predominantly according to performance-based incentives. Even if paying CHWs seems to be  difficult for the Burundi government which is already delaying achieving some UHC targets,  some initiatives can be implemented to complete the performance-based incentivisation. The  approach of social entrepreneurship among rural community health workers, a predominantly  female workforce, can be one of the solutions to empower economically CHWs and improve  PHC digitalization approach.
